| Midterm paper | There will be a five-page paper due as part of the midterm; this paper will focus on artworks on view in town and will require that you see the art in person. Focus questions for the paper will be handed out two weeks before the due date. Because it is part of the midterm, there will be no extensions for this paper. | ([PDF]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/assignments/mit4_651f10_paper1)) |
| Final paper | There will also be a 10-15 page research paper due in the last week of the semester. Suggested topics will be handed out well before; I strongly encourage you to come to office hours and meet with the T.A. to discuss your research topic, outline, bibliography, and strategies for writing. Consulting with the teaching assistant, using MIT's Writing Center, and taking advantage of peer review (to be explained in due course) will all help you craft a good humanities research paper. | ([PDF]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/assignments/mit4_651f10_paper2)) |
